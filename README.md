# quizzlerWithUI
Another quiz game made in Python, this time with UI.

# Note
This app is using API: "https://opentdb.com/api.php" for generating questions.

Max questions asked is 10 and you get scored on how many correct you have out of 10 (?/10).

You can tweak this to as many questions as you want.
